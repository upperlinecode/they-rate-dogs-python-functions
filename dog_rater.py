from random import randint
# 1. Write a function called basic_rating that takes in a dog's name and returns a string that says "_____ is a cute dog. ___/10"
#    For example, basic_rating("Spot") could return "Spot is a cute dog. 10/10"




# 2. Write a function called special_rating that takes in a dog's name, returns a better rating if the dog's name is one of your favorite names.





# 3. Write a function called type_rating that takes in a dog's breed, returns a better rating if the dog is one of your favorite types.




# 4. Write a function called ultimate_rating that takes in a dog's name and the dog's breed and returns a rating based on those two factors.
#    BONUS 1: If the user doesn't specify the dog's breed, the function should default to assuming the dog's breed is "unknown".
#    BONUS 2: If the dog's name is Apollo the Corgi, give the dog even more bonus points for being FAMOUS.
